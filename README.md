<h1>Greetings,</h1>
<p>My name is Graham Parr-Whalley, and I am an experienced Electronic Technician with over ten years of experience repairing and maintaining electronic equipment. I am now making a career transition to software development and have created this GitHub to track my journey.</p>
<p>As I embark on this new career path, I have set some goals for myself to achieve by March 28th:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Achieve a Codeforces Elo-MMR of 1000</li>
  <li>Solve and write-up 20+ Reverse Engineering Problems</li>
  <li>Solve and write-up 20+ Codeforces Problems</li>
</ul>
<p>I am committed to working hard, expanding my knowledge and skills in software development, and achieving these goals. I look forward to sharing my progress with you as I take on this exciting new challenge.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and interest.</p>
